A process is more than the program code, which is sometimes known as the text section. It also includes the current activity, as represented by the value of the program counter and the contents of the processor’s registers. A process generally also includes the process stack, which contains temporary data (such as function parameters, return addresses, and local variables), and a data section, which contains global variables. A process may also include a heap, which is memory that is dynamically allocated during process run time.

Each process may be in one of the following states: • New. The process is being created. • Running. Instructions are being executed. • Waiting. The process is waiting for some event to occur (such as an I/O completion or reception of a signal). • Ready. The process is waiting to be assigned to a processor. • Terminated. The process has finished execution.
